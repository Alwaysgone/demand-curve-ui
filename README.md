[![demand-curve-ui](https://github.com/Alwaysgone/demand-curve-ui/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Alwaysgone/demand-curve-ui/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml) [Demo](https://alwaysgone.github.io/demos/curve/www/index.html)

Use `wasm-pack build` in the project root to build the web assembly and run `npm install` in the `www` directory. When this is done it can be started using `npm run start` in the  `www` directory.
Changes to the web assembly are automatically available if `wasm-pack build` is executed in the project root with the previously started server.
